# ISC3U-GroupProject
Welcome to the project! This README file will contain a list of things that we will be working on. When you are working on something, make sure that everyting you do is in a seperate function so that we can easily add it to the game. When you are working on something make sure that you put your name next to it so that noone else accidentally works on the same project. COMMENT PLEASE, group project needs to be commented so that everyone can understand the logic behind it.

# Priorities:
- Procedurally generating forests - Rhys
- Procedurally generating castles and dungeon settings using rooms and corridors
- Biome linking and map layout- connecting different sections of the map - Connor
- Binding of Isaac style combat system - James
- Inventory system with storage
- Player skill tree I.E. one handed weapons, magic, etc.
- GUI design and user interface, confer with Connor (schmehl) or James for ideas/what we need
- Save system that saves all game progress to a file that can be read upon game restart 
- Economy algorithm based on supply and demand
- Design of civilizations and different biomes they can be situated in
- Story idea, basis for the game, can come later after more world design is finished
